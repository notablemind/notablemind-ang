All your mind. All your notes.

- org file backend
- lists of lists of lists
- todos
- notes
- quotes
- goats

I want all my notes in one place. 

I want to be able to take different kinds of notes.

I want notes to be able to link to each other. 

I want to attach files to notes.

Notable mind (currently) uses org-mode text files as the backend. In
the future, it will also support having a database backend, most
likely mongodb.
